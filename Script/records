The property was acquired at an attractive cost basis significantly below both peak pricing and replacement cost. This high-quality office park consists of a diverse mix of mid\/low-rise, two-story and single-story office\/flex buildings built from 1985 through 2006 in a low density, 184 acre corporate campus environment benefitting from strong local amenities, superior transportation access and a half mile of unimpaired visibility along the major I-465 freeway. With its strategic location and its unique ability to both accommodate and offer future flexibility to a wide canvas of corporate users, the properties should benefit from strong growth and occupancy trends. The portfolio also includes two development parcels (13 acres) that provide upside opportunity should market demand shift toward new supply.","1":"Edge Midtown is a 6-story, 146-unit Class A apartment building located in Nashville, Tennessee. It is one block north of The Dallas on Elliston and is within three blocks of Vanderbilt University and Baptist Hospital. The property location is convenient to many medical centers and amenities including restaurants, retail, and a bus rapid transit stop, all of which should be attractive to the property's target renters - young professionals, medical professionals, and graduate school students. The Nashville economy is well diversified with exposure to the education, healthcare and government industries. As a result of industry mix, Nashville weathered the economic storm better than other cities of its size. The Fund acquired the land and retained the same local developer that we are using at The Dallas on Elliston, Giarratana Associates, to develop the apartments on a fee incentive basis","2":"Opportunity to acquire leasehold interest in two stratum lots known as Precinct 1 and Precinct 3, King Street Wharf, Sydney. King Street Wharf is a waterfront location in Sydney, connecting Barangaroo to Cockle Bay and Darling Harbor and is well positioned to benefit from its proximity to the extensive development being undertaken in the area (Barangaroo, Darling Harbor Live precinct & International Convention Centre) via increased tourism and tenant population. Existing rents are believed to be 15% below market. There is potential to strata subdivide and sell the individual tenancies ","3":"The development is the continuation of LaSalle\u2019s strategic partnership with Zenith to develop a\nlogistics platform in China. The site is located in one of the key logistics parks in Wuhan, with convenient road\/railway\/water\naccess. The site is in the proximity to the Yangluo Port, which is the only natural deep water harbor\nalong the Yangtze River. Upon completion of phase 3, the Yangluo Port will become one of the largest\ninland river container ports in China. Zenith will provide a guarantee on construction cost which will minimize cost overrun risk.","4":"Off-market opportunity to acquire 30,146 sqm site directly from the land owner, located in Incheon City to develop a 42,127 sqm dry warehouse. Incheon City is a warehouse and logistics cluster (stored inventory primarily in consumer goods), approximately 30 miles from Greater Seoul, with route accessibilities connecting Kyungbu, Jungbu, and Youngdong expressways. Projected yield-on-cost of 9.1%"},"InvestmentOperation":{"0":"As of quarter-end, occupancy remained at 89%. During the quarter, we signed one new 22,403 sf lease with Progressive Insurance Company and four renewals totaling 10,457 sf. G3 Partners vacated 17,610 sf during the quarter and relocated to inexpensive sublease space in a different market. We also lost two other small tenants totaling 8,957 sf. One relocated downtown and the other was a MTM tenant paying minimal rent who relocated to inexpensive, long term space. We are continuing to demo and make ready certain vacated suites to expedite leasing.","1":"Newly delivered competitive supply continues to put pressure on market occupancy and net effective rents. New supply is offering aggressive concession levels that we are generally choosing not to meet. The property was 91% leased at quarter end, a decrease of 1% since last quarter. Interest from prospective tenants remains high. The leasing team has been focused on renewing current tenants' leases and stabilizing occupancy. Both properties are being aggressively marketed on social media and other internet search sites.","2":"The property was 99% leased at quarter-end. The remaining in-line vacant space (1,400 SF) is being actively marketed. During the quarter, Blaze Pizza opened its store in the new multi-tenant building. Sutter Health is\nscheduled to open in November","3":"During the quarter, Enterprise extended their lease for the 63-door Henderson, CO terminal an\nadditional five years to 3\/31\/2023.
