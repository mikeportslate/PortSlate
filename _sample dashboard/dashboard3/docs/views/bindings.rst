Keyboard and Mouse Bindings
===========================

For both the geographical and the logical views, bindings are the following :

* :guilabel:`Left-click (background)`: unselect all.
* :guilabel:`Left-click on a device`: open the property panel.
The property panel displays all properties of the object, and any property can be modified.
