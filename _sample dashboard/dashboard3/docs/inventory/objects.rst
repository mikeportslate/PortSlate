Objects

Type of objects
---------------

There are different types of devices and links available in eNMS.

* **Device**: router, switch, optical switch, server, host, antenna, regenerator, firewall.
* **Link**: ethernet link, optical link, etherchannel (LAG), optical channel, pseudowire, BGP peering.

Each type of device (resp. link) has a specific icon (resp. color) when displayed graphically:

Creation
--------

Inventory can be created from the :guilabel:`inventory/device_management` and :guilabel:`inventory/link_management` page, in two different ways:

* Manually, by entering the value of each property in a form (one by one).
* By importing an Excel file (.xls, .xlsx).

.. note:: Note: the workbook/tab names and column names in the Excel file should exactly match the examples provided with eNMS.

Manual creation
***************

Clicking on the ``Add a new device`` or ``Add a new link`` buttons will open a form with the list of all properties of the object.

Fill the form and click on the ``Submit`` button.

Creation via import
*******************

Objects can be created all at once by importing an Excel file. Devices must be defined in a spreadsheet in a Tab called "Device", and links must be defined in a Tab called "Link".
The first line of a spreadsheet contains the properties, the following lines define the objects, as demonstrated in the example below.

If you want to export the existing data, you can export an Excel spreadsheet containing all the object data by clicking: ``Export Network Topology``.

.. note:: You can find examples of such spreadsheets in :guilabel:`eNMS/projects`.
.. note:: If an imported object already exists, its properties will be updated.

Creation via external API
*************************

Another way to create your network is to query an external API: OpenNMS, Netbox, or LibreNMS.
This can be done from the :guilabel:`admin/administration` page.

OpenNMS
-------

   :alt: OpenNMS API
   :align: center

You can configure the following properties for OpenNMS:
 * ReST API: URL of the ReST API
 * Devices: URL of the devices that you want to import (this could be a subset of all available devices in the API, like ``https://demo.opennms.org/opennms/rest/nodes?foreignSource=OpenNMS_ATL``)
 * Type: Resulting eNMS type of the imported devices.
 * Login & Password: credentials of the ReST API.

Netbox
------

.. image:: /_static/inventory/import_export/netbox_api.png
   :alt: Netbox API
   :align: center

You can configure the following properties for OpenNMS:
 * Netbox Address: address of the server where Netbox is installed.
 * Netbox Token: token required by Netbox to use the API. This token is generated by Netbox.
 * Type: Resulting eNMS type of the imported devices.

LibreNMS
--------

.. image:: /_static/inventory/import_export/librenms_api.png
   :alt: LibreNMS API
   :align: center

You can configure the following properties for OpenNMS:
 * LibreNMS Address: address of the server where LibreNMS is installed.
 * LibreNMS Token: token required by LibreNMS to use the API. This token is generated by LibreNMS.
 * Type: Resulting eNMS type of the imported devices.

Properties
----------

Some properties are mandatory:
 * Name: objects are uniquely defined by their name.
 * Source and destination: a link needs a source and a destination to be created.

.. tip:: In order to visualize the network topology on a map, devices must have geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).

Custom properties
-----------------

It is possible to add custom properties to a device.
There are four types of properties that you can add: string, integer, float, and boolean.

Custom properties are read from a YAML file when eNMS starts.
The YAML file must have the following format:

::

 property1:
   pretty_name: Property 1
   type: integer
   default: 4
   add_to_dashboard: False
 property2:
   pretty_name: Property 2
   type: string
   default: "10.145.14.1"
   add_to_dashboard: True
   is_address: True

This YAML file will create two properties:
- "property1": an integer property defaulting to 4, displayed "Property 1" in the GUI.
- "property2": a string property defaulting to "a" displayed "Property 2" in the GUI.

If you want the custom property to appear in the dashboard, set ``add_to_dashboard`` to ``True`` in the YaML file.
The ``pretty_name`` is the name of the property in the web UI.

If you want the custom property to appear as a choice in the GoTTY Web SSH window (e.g if the property is a hostname or an IP address, and you want GoTTY to use it for SSH or Telnet), you can set ``is_address`` to True.

.. note:: You can find examples of YAML files with custom propertyes in :guilabel:`eNMS/tests/custom_properties`.

For eNMS to know where the file with custom properties is located on the server, you must set the ``PATH_CUSTOM_PROPERTIES`` environment variable to the path of the YAML file.

::

 # set the PATH_CUSTOM_PROPERTIES environment variable
 export PATH_CUSTOM_PROPERTIES=/path/to/yaml/file
